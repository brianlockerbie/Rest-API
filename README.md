This is the ninth of ten projects for the 🏡 Treehouse TechDegree Full Stack JavaScript.

In this project, I created a REST API using Express. The API provides a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, as well as adding, updating and deleting courses in the database. Users are required to create an account and log-in to make changes to the database.

Techniques and Concepts: Node.js, REST API, Express.js, Sequelize ORM, Express Validator & DB Browser for SQLite
